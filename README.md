# IP Service Protocol

A specification for an application-level internet protocol that serves usage and contact information for a TCP service.

## Motivation

I do not know of any protocols that fill a similar role. Besides, writing a specification is fun!

## Specification

See [*spec.md*](./spec.md).

## Reference Implementation

In the top-level of this repository is the source code for the Rust crate *ip-service-protocol*, which offers client and server CLI programs.
